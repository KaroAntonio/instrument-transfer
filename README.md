# Instrument Transfer

This is mostly entirely [GRUV](https://github.com/MattVitelli/GRUV), with a few tweaks to train from one input to a seperate output.

GOAL:   
1. train model on X with a source instrument and Y with target instrument  
2. translate a single track melody from X instrument to Y
